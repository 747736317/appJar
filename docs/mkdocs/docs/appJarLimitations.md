# Limitations
---

## General Limitations:
 * Animated GIFs - appJar has its own way of animating GIFs, if animated GIFs don't have complete frames, the animation will break.    
 * Image Backgrounds - setting an image as a background doesn't work well - most widgets don't have their own transparency.  
 # ttk - appJar was never intended to work with ttk, but due to popular demand, we've tried to build it in, but there are still issues.  

## Platform Limitations:  

appJar has been designed to work the same on the three major platforms: Windows, Mac & Linux.  
However, not all features are available on all platforms.  

### Linux:  
* Transparency does not work.  
* favicons aren;t available.  

### Mac:  
* Pasting some special characters on Mac will crash appJar  
* Tickbox Option List on Mac  
* Button BG & Resizing on Mac  
* favicons on Mac & Linux  

### Windows:  
* n/a
